# PREDICTING THE LOCATION OF THE NEXT FIREARM CRIME IN TORONTO
Toronto Police Service (TPS) is the city's law enforcement agency with 7,600 uniformed and civilian members. It comprises 17 police divisions and handles various safety and law enforcement responsibilities

The purpose of this project is to devise predictive models for the Toronto Police Services (TPS) to prognosticate potential shooting related crime occurrences based on neighborhoods and assess impact of external factors such as education and employment rates 

Our analysis consisted of performing data cleaning practices and exploratory analysis to assess high and low crime areas and which variables impact those statistics. Post that, we built a KNN-regression model to forecast location of potential criminal incidents; our model demonstrated exceptionally impressive R-squared values - of 0.93 and 0.84 - in predicting latitude and longitude values respectively for neighborhoods with high crime rate

Based on the built predictive models and the analysis conducted, our strategic recommendations for the Toronto police consists of a three-pronged approach: re-organize, re-allocate, and re-invest the available resources to effectively curb the increase in crime rates and enhance overall public safety to potentially reduce crime rates across neighborhoods and build a safer society for citizens
